Generic hierarchical cache implementation

This file implements a Cacheable base class as well as a Cache class that allows
other Cacheable objects (including other Cache instance) to be registered to.
Each Cacheable solely needs to implement a gettable and settable state property.
Each Cache object can be (de-)serialised from/to a file as a JSON stream, and it
will do so recursively for all registered Cacheables. For example, this is what
a cache tree might look like:

  Cache('root')
  |
  +---- Cache('foo')
  |     |
  |     +---- Cacheable Object('a')
  |     |
  |     `---- Cacheable Object('b')
  |
  `---- Cacheable Object('c')
